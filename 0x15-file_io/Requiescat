Reuiescat
by OScar Wilde

Tread lightly, she is near
Under the snow,
Speak gently, she is near
The daisies grow.

All her bright golden hair
Tarnished with rust,
She that was young and fair
Fallen to dust.

Lily-like, white as snow,
She hardly knew
she was a woaman, so
Sweetly she grew/

Coffin-board, heavy stone,
Lie on her breast,
I vex my heart alone,
She is at rest.
